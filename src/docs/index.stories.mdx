This repository contains Nest's React components for use across the business. The main purpose of this project is to provide a single source of truth of components for use internally and across all client projects.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v9+
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) v16+
- [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) v1.25+ (for component style modules only)

## Usage
Simply install from npm:

```zsh
$ npm i @nestagencyuk/react_components
```

Import the desired components into your .jsx or .tsx files. This will include the components in their unstyled format. To include styles, include the compiled `main.css` file straight into your project.

> For creating themes and overriding our base styles, see our [style docs](/?path=/docs/getting-started-styles--page)

```js
import { Button } from '@nestagencyuk/react_components'
import '@nestagencyuk/react_components/dist/assets/main.css' // Optional

ReactDOM.render(<Button />, document.getElementById('app'))
```
