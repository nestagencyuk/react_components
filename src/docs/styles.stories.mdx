# Styles
All the styles you see within this library can be used unmodified, by simply importing the compiled `main.css` into your consumer project, as explained on our [intro page](/?path=/docs/getting-started-introduction--page). However most implementations will require some sort of theme modification. Instead of having to battle with overriding styles, you can instead omit including it and instead use our modular internal [scss library](https://github.com/nestagencyuk/scss_lib) to create a **theme**.

## Requirements
- [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) v1.25+ 

## Usage
To use the library to create a theme, first install:

```zsh
$ npm i @nestagencyuk/scss_lib
```

This package contains all of the styles you see here in this component library, but in their pre-compiled state; ready for theming. Each component and config is exported as individual "modules", meaning you only have to include the styles that you need. [Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuring-modules) are a relatively new (and awesome!) feature of Sass which solve a lot of config/library related issues. We prefer this method as it provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to easily override default styles.

### Setup
Create an `index.scss` file somewhere in your project and paste the code below. You can omit files that you find unnecessary as you become familiar with how the theming works - this is simply to demonstrate the options available.

### Making changes

#### Config
Each config file has a set of overrideable variables which you can pass to the module. For example, to change the core colours, simply pass the new variable to the module using the `@use` directive:

```scss
@use '@nestagencyuk/scss_lib/dist/_colours' with (
  $brand-one: green,
  $brand-two: pink,
);
```

> For these changes to apply everywhere, config files should always come first so that the variables are set before 

> When adding your brand colours, we advise your `$brand-one` be the darker of the two.

#### Config
Components will work in exactly the same way, although some have more powerful overrides available which will auto-generate BEM modifiers for you. A good example is the Button component, which has a `$types` map. To change the button types, simply override the whole map:

```scss
@use '@nestagencyuk/scss_lib/dist/button' with (
  $types: (
    primary: (
      background-color: colours.$brand-one,
      color: colours.$brand-two,

      ':hover': (
        color: black
      )
    ),
    secondary: (
      background-color: colours.$brand-two,
      color: colours.$brand-one,

      ':hover': (
        color: white
      )
    ),
    // and so forth...
  )
);
```

For each component's available variables, see their respective page here in the docs! Scss will also fail to compile if the variable is not found.
