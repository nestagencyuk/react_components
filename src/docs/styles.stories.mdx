# Styles
All the styles you see within this library can be used unmodified, by simply importing the compiled `main.css` into your consumer project, as explained on our [intro page](/?path=/docs/getting-started-introduction--page). However some implementations will require some sort of theme modification, for example if we are fetching colours and fonts from an external source, such as a CMS. Instead of having to battle with overriding styles, you can instead opt to use the modular SCSS shipped with this library to create a **theme**.

## Requirements
- [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) v1.25+ 

## Usage
To use the library to create a theme, first we assume you have a SCSS loader in your consumer project and that you've installed the package:

```zsh
$ npm i @nestagencyuk/react_components
```

This library utilises SCSS "modules", meaning you can easily override certain theme variables. [Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuring-modules) are a relatively new (and awesome!) feature of Sass which solve a lot of config/library related issues.

### Setup
Create a `theme.scss` file somewhere in your project and paste the code below. This will import all the component styles from the library, ready for theming.

```scss
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Theme

/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

/// -------------------
/// Library variable overrides
/// ------------------- 

@use '@nestagencyuk/react_components/theme';
```

### Making changes

To make changes to certain variables, simply override them using the theme as a `module`, like so:

```scss
/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

/// Theme

/// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

/// -------------------
/// Library variable overrides
/// ------------------- 

@use '@nestagencyuk/react_components/theme' with (
  $brand-one: green,
  $brand-two: pink,

  $font-family: ('Roboto', sans-serif),
  $font-family--alt: ('Open Sans', sans-serif),
);
```

And that's about it! Only certain variables are themeable (documentation on this coming soon), so any major style changes should be made directly within the library itself.

> **NOTE:** When adding your brand colours, we advise your `$brand-one` be the **darker** of the two.
