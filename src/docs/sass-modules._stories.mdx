# Sass Modules

This package exports individual modules with each component, meaning you only have to include the styles that you need. [Modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuring-modules) are a relatively new (and awesome!) feature of Sass which solves a lot of config/library related issues. We prefer this method as it provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to easily override default styles.

## Requirements
- [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) v1.25+ 

## Basic Usage:
To include the base/default styles without modification, simply include the module reference at the top of your component's .scss file.

Component.scss
```scss
@use '~nest-components/dist/scss/Component';
```
OR you can use the module but override the variables within to create truly unique variations!:

Component.scss
```scss
@use '~nest-components/dist/scss/Component' with (
  $component-var-one: blue,
  $component-var-two: red,
);
```

For each component's variables, see their respective page here in the docs!
