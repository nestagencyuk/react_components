# Introduction

This repository contains Nest's React components for use across the business. The main purpose of this project is to provide a single source of truth of components for use internally and across all client projects. When consuming this library for client projects, our brand CSS should be excluded.

### Requirements: 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v9+
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) v16+

### Basic Usage:
Install:
```sh
$ npm i nest-components
```

Import the desired components into your .jsx or .tsx files. Including the CSS is optional - the styles fit our own branding so may not be suitable for client work. For the CSS import to work, your library consumer will need a way of handling CSS imports (webpack css-loader for example):

```js
import { Button } from 'nest-components'
import 'nest-components/dist/main.css' // Optional - only include if workng on Nest branded products

ReactDOM.render(<Button />, document.getElementById('app'))
```
